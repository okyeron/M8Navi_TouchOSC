# M8Navi_TouchOSC

TouchOSC template to control Headless version of the M8 Tracker

Still a bit of a work in progress

### M8_MIDI

This works over MIDI with M8 Headless. 

Only tested so far on iPad and a wireless MIDI "Network Session" setup to a Macbook pro running the M8 Headless TouchDesigner project.


### M8_OSC

This uses the enclosed (not-official) version of the M8 Headless TouchDesigner project file, which has been modified to accept OSC commands for the M8 keys.
